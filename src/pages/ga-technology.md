# How Google Analytics Affects Your Privacy

My website has started using Google Analytics (GA) technology to better understand how visitors interact with my content. This helps me improve the user experience. However, I also recognize the importance of privacy and transparency. This page explains what data is collected, how it is used, and how you can control your privacy settings.

## What Data Does Google Analytics Collect?
Google Analytics collects various types of data to analyze website traffic, including:

- **IP Address** (anonymized in most cases)
- **Device Information** (browser, operating system, screen resolution)
- **User Behavior** (pages visited, time spent, interactions)
- **Referring Source** (how you arrived at the site, such as search engines or links)
- **Cookies** (used to track returning visitors and user interactions)

## How Is This Data Used?
I use the insights from Google Analytics to:

- Understand which pages and content are most engaging
- Improve website performance and usability
- Identify potential issues or broken links
- Measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns

The data collected through Google Analytics is aggregated and does not personally identify users. However, Google may process some data as part of its broader services.

## How to Control Your Privacy
If you want to limit or opt out of Google Analytics tracking, you have several options:

- **Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On**: Install [Google's opt-out extension](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to prevent GA from collecting your data.
- **Adjust Browser Settings**: Disable cookies or use private browsing mode to limit tracking.
- **Manage Google Ad Settings**: Control personalized ads and data collection via your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization).
- **Disable JavaScript**: Google Analytics relies on JavaScript, so disabling it in your browser can prevent tracking (note that this may affect other website functionality).
