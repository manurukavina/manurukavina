Audio processing at the assembly level was a cool challenge, merging DSP principles with the  control of low-level programming. here is how i did some stuff:

## Understanding Audio Waveforms

Audio waves are typically represented as sequences of digital samples, which are discrete values representing the amplitude of the sound at a given time. These samples can be:
- **8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit integers** (PCM format)
- **Floating-point values**
- **Compressed formats (MP3, AAC)**, which require additional decoding steps

For assembly-level processing, we generally deal with PCM data, which is stored as signed or unsigned integers.

## Processing Audio in Assembly

### 1. Loading Audio Data

Before performing any processing, the audio file (e.g., WAV format) must be read into memory. This typically involves:
- Parsing the WAV header to extract sample rate, bit depth, and number of channels
- Allocating a buffer to hold raw PCM data
- Using system calls (like `read` in Linux or `ReadFile` in Windows) to load the data

```assembly
; Example: x86-64 NASM to read a file into a buffer
mov rdi, file_descriptor    ; File descriptor
mov rsi, buffer            ; Destination buffer
mov rdx, buffer_size       ; Number of bytes to read
syscall                    ; Invoke system call (Linux)
```

### 2. Applying Basic Audio Effects

#### a) Volume Control (Scaling Amplitude)
To increase or decrease volume, we scale each sample by a factor:

```assembly
; Assuming 16-bit signed PCM data in an array
mov ax, [buffer]          ; Load sample
imul ax, volume_factor    ; Scale amplitude
sar ax, 8                 ; Normalize (assuming factor is 8-bit fixed point)
mov [buffer], ax          ; Store modified sample
```

#### b) Echo Effect (Delayed Addition)
An echo effect can be implemented by mixing delayed samples with the original waveform:

```assembly
; Simple echo: y[n] = x[n] + 0.5 * x[n - delay]
mov ax, [buffer + delay]   ; Fetch old sample
sar ax, 1                  ; Scale by 0.5
add [buffer], ax           ; Mix with current sample
```

### 3. FFT for Frequency Analysis
For frequency-domain processing (e.g., equalizers, reverb), we use the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**. Implementing FFT in assembly involves:
1. Bit-reversal permutation of input samples
2. Iterative butterfly operations for DFT computation
3. Applying windowing and scaling as needed

Though a full FFT implementation is complex, an optimized **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) approach** using **AVX or SSE** instructions can significantly speed up processing.

```assembly
; Simplified SSE-based addition of two audio sample arrays
movaps xmm0, [buffer1]   ; Load 4 float samples
movaps xmm1, [buffer2]   ; Load another set
addps xmm0, xmm1         ; Perform parallel addition
movaps [buffer_out], xmm0 ; Store result
```

### 4. Writing Processed Audio Back
After processing, the modified PCM data must be written back to an output file. This follows the same procedure as reading but in reverse:
- Open a new file for writing
- Write the WAV header
- Write PCM data using system calls

```assembly
; Write buffer to file
mov rdi, output_fd       ; Output file descriptor
mov rsi, buffer          ; Buffer containing PCM data
mov rdx, buffer_size     ; Number of bytes to write
syscall                  ; Invoke write system call
```

## Optimizing Performance
Since audio processing is computationally intensive, optimization techniques include:
- **Using SIMD instructions (SSE/AVX) for parallel processing**
- **Loop unrolling** to reduce branching overhead
- **Efficient memory access** to minimize cache misses
- **Fixed-point arithmetic** to avoid floating-point overhead on low-power systems
